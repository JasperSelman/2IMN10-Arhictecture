Nowadays the gaming industry is one of the most rapidly expanding industries in the world. Especially the multiplayer online games. Due to the vast success of games like World of Warcraft, the amount of vendors of massive multiplayer online games increased, interesting to know therefore is how the architecture of all these games is designed, since this kind of games give a great example of how a distributed architecture works in real life. In this paper we will take a deeper look at this architecture. We will elaborate on the architectural and interaction styles used in the following papers: \emph{Practical Middleware for Massively Multiplayer Online Games} \cite{middleware}, \emph{Requirements of Peer-to-Peer-based Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming} \cite{peer} and \emph{Towards Service Oriented Architecture for MMOG} \cite{service}. We shall also describe how these design choices affect the view of the game state and compare how well the architectures work with respect to performance aspects.\\
