The gaming industry is currently one of the most rapidly expanding industries in the world, in particular the multiplayer online variant. 
Due to the vast success of games like World of Warcraft, the amount of producers for massive multiplayer online games has increased significantly.
However, due to the number of players involved in these massive multiplayer online games, the requirements and concerns for data transfer between components has changed, compared to games before.
This has sparked the research and development of many new architectures and datastructures to address these. \\
Therefore, it is rather interesting to know how the architecture of all these games are designed, and the problems they address.
In this paper we will take a deeper look at some of these architectures. 
We will elaborate on the architectural and interaction styles used in the following papers: \emph{Practical Middleware for Massively Multiplayer Online Games} \cite{middleware}, \emph{Requirements of Peer-to-Peer-based Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming} \cite{peer} and \emph{Towards Service Oriented Architecture for MMOG} \cite{service}. 
We shall also describe how these design choices affect the view of the game state and compare how well the architectures work with respect to performance aspects.
