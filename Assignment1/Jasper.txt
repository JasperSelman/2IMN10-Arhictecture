1. What building blocks do you see? What do they represent? 
Are they conceptual or physical?
The building blocks we see are the Firewalls (conceptual). The purpose of these firewalls are obvious security reasons,
such that the site is protected from malicious attacks. We also see load balancers and filtering. These are for work distribution and are also conceptual.
The other componenets are all physical, namely the servers (application and database), databases and NASses. These are for storing and sharing the information on the site.

2. Same questions as 1, but now for the connectors?
You see the red lines connecting components within a site to each other. 
This represent how components in a site are linked to each other and with which components they can communicate.
You also see the green arrows, these connectors show how the main site communicates with the secondary site(s).
All these connectors are conceptual.

3. To which views (1..*) does the model belong?
	Motivate why, and identify corresponding stakeholders and their concerns.
We see a clear Design view with regards to the communication. You can clearly see which components should interact with other components.
You can also clearly see the Deployment view. You can clearly see all the components in the view and it gives an overview of the services. 	

4. Which of the following EFRs are addressed (Y + motivation | N)?
	Performance/Scalability, availability/reliability, security, maintainability?
Security: Yes, the use of firewalls and synchronous replications define the security.
Performance/Scalability: Yes, the use of the filtering and clustering give notion of the performance of the model.
Also the scalable parts are shown in groups from 1, 2 to N.
Availability/Reliability: No
Maintainability: No
Operability: Flow through the network is shown. 

5. Is there a concept of distribution (Y + motivation | N)?
Yes, You can clearly see the flow throughout the system. You see load balancers, applications, 
filters, Clustered Databases, Severs and NASses and how these are linked to each other. 

6.  Comment on the clarity/semantics of the diagram
You can clearly see how all the components in the sites and how they are connected. 
Different components have there own coloring and smaller parts of the model, belonging to each other are structured in a group (dashed lines).
Different ways of communication are shown with different arrows. 
Not really clear what the model does precisely and what users/systems are using it.
